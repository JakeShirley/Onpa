# Development Guide

This project should be versioned and released with semantic-release.

## Versioning And Releases

Use semantic-release as the source of truth for release versions, release notes, and Git tags. Do not manually choose release versions or hand-edit generated changelog entries as part of normal feature work.

Expected release model:

- Commits use Conventional Commits.
- semantic-release analyzes commits to decide the next version.
- CI publishes release notes and tags when changes land on the release branch.
- iOS marketing versions should be derived from the semantic-release version during release automation.
- iOS build numbers can remain CI-generated monotonic build identifiers.
- Checked-in Xcode and package versions stay at `0.0.0-development`; release builds pass the semantic-release version to `xcodebuild` without committing that bump back to the repository.

The release workflow intentionally does not use `@semantic-release/git`, `@semantic-release/changelog`, or any other plugin that commits generated version or changelog changes back to the repository.

## Commit Message Format

All feature, bug fix, maintenance, documentation, test, and CI commits should use semantic-release-compatible Conventional Commits:

```text
<type>(optional-scope): [PLAN-ID] <description>

optional body

optional footer
```

Include one or more project plan step IDs from `docs/BIRDNET_GO_IOS_PROJECT_PLAN.md` near the start of the subject. Use the relevant backlog ID for the work being implemented, fixed, or documented. If a commit spans multiple planned steps, include each ID in separate brackets.

Examples:

```text
feat: [FND-004] persist active station profile
feat(feed): [DET-001] add recent detections list
fix(auth): [CON-004] support password-only station login
docs: [FND-002] document app architecture boundaries
refactor(storage): [FND-004] split profile persistence protocol
feat: [CON-001] [CON-002] validate manual station connection
```

For repository-only work that does not map to a planned backlog step, use `[NO-PLAN]` and explain why in the commit body.

Common types:

- `feat`: user-visible feature or capability.
- `fix`: user-visible bug fix.
- `perf`: performance improvement.
- `refactor`: code restructuring with no intended behavior change.
- `test`: test-only change.
- `docs`: documentation-only change.
- `build`: build system or dependency change.
- `ci`: CI workflow change.
- `chore`: repository maintenance that does not affect released behavior.

Breaking changes must use either a `!` after the type or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:

```text
feat(api)!: require authenticated station profiles
```

```text
feat(api): require authenticated station profiles

BREAKING CHANGE: unauthenticated saved station profiles must be migrated before use.
```

Examples:

```text
feat(feed): [DET-002] add live detection stream
fix(auth): [CON-005] refresh csrf token after login
docs(release): [NO-PLAN] document semantic-release workflow
test(api): [CON-002] add station config decoding fixtures
ci(release): [NO-PLAN] add semantic-release workflow
```

## Agent And Contributor Expectations

- Do not make a Git commit unless explicitly asked.
- When asked to commit, use a Conventional Commit message that semantic-release can analyze and include the relevant project plan step tag.
- Prefer small commits with one release meaning each.
- Do not manually edit generated release notes, tags, or version bumps unless the release automation itself is being fixed.
- If a change is user-visible, choose `feat`, `fix`, or `perf` instead of hiding it under `chore`.
- Keep release-impacting changes separate from unrelated documentation or cleanup when practical.

## Debug App Configuration

The app supports debug station configuration through launch arguments and environment variables:

```sh
xcrun simctl launch --terminate-running-process <device-id> com.jakeshirley.birdnetgo --args -initialTab station -stationURL http://192.168.1.50:8080
```

Supported debug inputs:

- `-stationURL <url>` or `-debugStationURL <url>`: prefill and override the active station URL for the launch.
- `BIRDNET_GO_STATION_URL=<url>`: environment equivalent of `-stationURL`.
- `-useLocalStationProfile`: prefill a local test station profile when no station profile is saved.
- `-localStationURL <url>`: override the local test profile URL. Defaults to `http://localhost:8080`.
- `-debugDetectionID <id>`: open a detection detail screen on launch for visual simulator checks.
- `-debugSpeciesName <name>`: open a species detail screen after the Species or Dashboard tab loads for visual simulator checks.
- `-initialTab <dashboard|feed|species|station>`: choose the launch tab. `stats` remains accepted as a legacy alias for `dashboard`.
- `BIRDNET_GO_USE_LOCAL_STATION_PROFILE=1`: environment equivalent of `-useLocalStationProfile`.
- `BIRDNET_GO_LOCAL_STATION_URL=<url>`: environment equivalent of `-localStationURL`.
- `BIRDNET_GO_DEBUG_DETECTION_ID=<id>`: environment equivalent of `-debugDetectionID`.
- `BIRDNET_GO_DEBUG_SPECIES_NAME=<name>`: environment equivalent of `-debugSpeciesName`.

The active station profile and app preferences are persisted with `UserDefaults`. Station credentials remain Keychain-only, and session cookies remain ephemeral.

User-facing errors should flow through `AppError` so offline, authentication, TLS, rate limit, server, URL, and invalid station responses use consistent language across features. The Station tab can generate a local diagnostics bundle for troubleshooting; diagnostics redact station hosts, usernames, tokens, cookies, and passwords before writing a shareable text file under the app caches directory.

## Screenshot Tooling

Use the tracked screenshot runner to refresh README images after visible UI changes:

```sh
npm run screenshots
```

The runner builds the Debug simulator app, starts [scripts/mock_birdnet_go_server.js](../scripts/mock_birdnet_go_server.js), installs the app on the simulator, launches the Dashboard, Feed, Species, and Station tabs, and writes PNGs to [docs/screenshots](screenshots). The mock station can also be run on its own for manual checks:

```sh
npm run mock-station
```

Useful overrides:

- `DEVICE_NAME="iPhone 17"` and `IOS_VERSION=26.1` choose the simulator destination.
- `SCREENSHOT_DIR=path/to/output` writes screenshots somewhere else.
- `SKIP_BUILD=1` reuses the existing app in `build/DerivedData`.
- `MOCK_PORT=18082` avoids a port conflict with another local fixture.

## App Structure

The iOS app keeps foundation code in separate source areas so feature work can grow without mixing concerns:

- `BirdNETGo/App`: SwiftUI app entry point, tab shell, app configuration, and dependency environment wiring.
- `BirdNETGo/Domain`: shared app models, detection DTOs, and domain state.
- `BirdNETGo/Networking`: BirdNET-Go API client protocols, URLSession implementations, and SSE stream parsing.
- `BirdNETGo/Storage`: storage protocols, UserDefaults-backed profile/preference persistence, local cache storage, and Keychain-backed credential storage.
- `BirdNETGo/Features`: user-facing SwiftUI feature modules such as Dashboard, Feed, DetectionDetail, Species, and Station. Feature view models own screen state and call dependencies through `AppEnvironment`.

The Feed feature keeps recent-list refresh and live streaming separate: pull-to-refresh fetches `/api/v2/detections/recent?limit=10`, while the view model's live task listens to `/api/v2/detections/stream`, deduplicates incoming detections by ID, updates the same local cache, and reconnects with capped exponential backoff.

The Species feature loads `/api/v2/species` for station catalog enrichment and augments the list with recent detection summaries from `/api/v2/detections/recent`. Because BirdNET-Go stations may reject the catalog endpoint depending on configuration or version, catalog failures are quiet when recent detections can still populate the detected-species list. The species response decoder accepts both bare arrays and common response envelopes so it can tolerate BirdNET-Go API shape changes, and the merged list is cached per station for stale offline fallback. Species rows open detail pages that request `/api/v2/detections?queryType=species&species=<name>&numResults=<n>` for recent species-specific detections, use `/api/v2/media/species-image?name=<scientific-name>` for the hero image, and expose playable audio samples through `/api/v2/audio/:id`.

The Dashboard tab loads `/api/v2/analytics/species/daily?date=<yyyy-mm-dd>&limit=<n>` for the selected day and renders the returned `hourly_counts` as a per-species heatmap. Heatmap species rows link to the Species detail screen. It also fetches `/api/v2/detections/recent` for the Currently Hearing strip. If daily analytics are unavailable but recent detections load, the view builds a same-day summary from recent detections; successful dashboard payloads are cached per station and date for stale offline fallback.

Detection detail uses `/api/v2/detections/:id` for the canonical detail payload. Audio playback uses a station-relative `/api/v2/audio/:id` URL with `AVPlayer`; the auth-only clip extraction endpoint is intentionally left for later media editing work.

Species images on detection detail use `/api/v2/media/species-image?name=<scientific-name>` and attribution metadata from `/api/v2/media/species-image/info?name=<scientific-name>`. Attribution is treated as non-critical: missing or unavailable metadata does not block the detail screen, while available author and license values are shown on the image.

Weather and time-of-day context are loaded as non-critical detail supplements. The app requests `/api/v2/weather/detection/:id` for weather near the detection time and `/api/v2/detections/:id/time-of-day` for the explicit sun-position bucket, falling back to weather or detection payload values if the dedicated time-of-day endpoint is unavailable.

Spectrogram display uses the ID-based media endpoints with `size=lg&raw=true`, matching BirdNET-Go's compact web players by requesting an image without generated axes or legends. The app checks `/api/v2/spectrogram/:id/status` first, displays `/api/v2/spectrogram/:id` when the status is `exists` or `generated`, and fetches `/api/v2/app/config` so it can attach the current CSRF token before posting to `/api/v2/spectrogram/:id/generate`. Missing spectrograms are generated automatically by default; users can turn off Auto Fetch Spectrograms in Station > Media and generate them manually from the detail player. The detail media surface combines audio playback and spectrogram display so `AVPlayer` progress is overlaid as a vertical playhead on the image.
