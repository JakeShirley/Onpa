# BirdNET-Go iOS Project Plan

Last updated: 2026-04-26
Status: Implementation started. FND-001 has established the native SwiftUI app shell.

## Purpose

Build a native iOS companion app for BirdNET-Go stations. The app should help a user connect to one or more BirdNET-Go instances, monitor live and historical bird detections, play related media, receive useful alerts, and eventually perform safe station administration from an iPhone or iPad.

This document is the long-term planning and progress tracker for Copilot and future contributors. Update it whenever a feature is implemented, deferred, redesigned, or blocked.

## Sources Consulted

- Local BirdNET-Go source: `/Users/jakeshirley/birdnet-go/`
- BirdNET-Go upstream repository: `https://github.com/tphakala/birdnet-go`
- BirdNET-Go API v2 docs: `/Users/jakeshirley/birdnet-go/internal/api/v2/README.md`
- BirdEcho, previously Perch, adjacent mobile app: `https://github.com/arunrajiah/birdecho`
- Apple iOS developer overview for iOS 26-era platform direction: `https://developer.apple.com/ios/`
- Apple Liquid Glass adoption guidance: `https://developer.apple.com/documentation/TechnologyOverviews/adopting-liquid-glass`
- Apple Intelligence and WidgetKit developer guidance: `https://developer.apple.com/apple-intelligence/`, `https://developer.apple.com/widgets/`

## Product Direction

The app should be a direct BirdNET-Go companion, not a standalone bird classifier. BirdNET-Go remains the station-side analyzer and source of truth. The iOS app should focus on station connection, realtime monitoring, historical exploration, media playback, notifications, and selected station management.

Recommended initial stack:

- Native iOS app using Swift, SwiftUI, Swift Concurrency, Observation, and the latest stable Xcode/iOS SDK available when implementation begins.
- `URLSession` for REST and SSE networking, using async/await and a single shared realtime connection manager per station.
- `AVPlayer` for audio clips and HLS live audio.
- SwiftData for local cache, station profiles, and preferences unless real captured data shows a need for lower-level SQLite.
- Keychain for credentials and station tokens.
- UserNotifications for local notifications in the first release, with APNs and ActivityKit push notifications considered later if a server-side relay is introduced.
- WidgetKit, App Intents, ActivityKit, and Control Center controls as planned platform extensions, not initial app dependencies.
- Foundation Models and other Apple Intelligence APIs only for optional, privacy-preserving convenience features. BirdNET-Go remains the detection engine and source of truth.

Rationale: the app is iOS-specific, needs Keychain, background behavior, notifications, media playback, local network permissions, and a polished Apple platform experience. SwiftUI keeps the first app small while leaving room for iPad, widgets, controls, Live Activities, App Intents, and watchOS later. Build with the latest SDK to pick up current platform behavior, but gate iOS 26-only APIs with availability checks if the minimum deployment target is older.

## Current iOS Platform Direction

These notes reflect current Apple platform guidance as of April 2026. They should be revisited after WWDC26 and whenever the project chooses a minimum iOS version.

| Area | Planning Impact |
| --- | --- |
| iOS 26 design | Use standard SwiftUI navigation, lists, forms, sheets, toolbars, controls, and system colors so the app adopts Liquid Glass automatically. Avoid hard-coded custom chrome that would fight the system material. |
| Navigation | Keep the tab-based phone app, but structure it so `TabView` can adapt to iPad sidebars with `NavigationSplitView` and sidebar-adaptable tab behavior. Consider a dedicated Search tab role once search becomes a primary workflow. |
| Forms and settings | Prefer SwiftUI `Form` and standard grouped layouts for station setup, settings, and admin screens. Test larger row metrics, sheet corners, reduced transparency, increased contrast, and reduced motion. |
| Icons and visual assets | Plan a layered app icon using Icon Composer, plus SF Symbols for toolbar/menu actions. Avoid custom icon treatments that duplicate system effects. |
| Widgets and Live Activities | Treat WidgetKit as a single strategy for widgets, Live Activities, controls, and watch complications. Start with one glanceable feature, then expand across contexts. |
| App Intents | Model core user actions as App Intents over time: open latest detection, check station status, start live audio, show favorite species, and refresh widgets/controls. |
| Apple Intelligence | Consider Foundation Models for optional local summarization, natural-language filtering, and station diagnostics explanations. Do not use generative features for species identification decisions or anything that changes station state without explicit user action. |
| Passkeys | Passkeys are worth supporting only if BirdNET-Go or an upstream auth provider exposes WebAuthn/OIDC flows that can work cleanly on iOS. Do not invent an app-only auth scheme. |
| Background behavior | iOS still constrains long-running background networking. Plan foreground SSE, cache-aware widgets, APNs-backed updates, and explicit background audio policy instead of assuming continuous background polling. |

## BirdNET-Go Integration Surface

BirdNET-Go exposes a v2 HTTP API under `/api/v2`. There is no OpenAPI spec in the current local source, so the canonical API reference is the BirdNET-Go API README in `internal/api/v2/README.md`.

Key endpoints for the initial app:

| Area | Endpoint | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Connectivity | `GET /api/v2/ping` | Lightweight online check. |
| Health | `GET /api/v2/health` | Station health check. |
| App config | `GET /api/v2/app/config` | Public config, security state, version, CSRF token source. |
| Auth | `POST /api/v2/auth/login` | Login with server-side rate limiting. |
| Auth | `POST /api/v2/auth/logout` | Auth required. |
| Auth | `GET /api/v2/auth/status` | Auth required. |
| Detection list | `GET /api/v2/detections` | Public detection list with filtering. |
| Recent detections | `GET /api/v2/detections/recent` | Public recent feed. |
| Detection detail | `GET /api/v2/detections/:id` | Public detection detail. |
| Search | `POST /api/v2/search` | Public advanced search. |
| Live detections | `GET /api/v2/detections/stream` | Public, rate-limited SSE. |
| Sound levels | `GET /api/v2/soundlevels/stream` | Public, rate-limited SSE. |
| Audio levels | `GET /api/v2/streams/audio-level` | Public SSE, connection-limited. |
| Audio clip | `GET /api/v2/audio/:id` | Public playback by detection ID. |
| Spectrogram | `GET /api/v2/spectrogram/:id` | Public spectrogram image by detection ID. |
| Spectrogram status | `GET /api/v2/spectrogram/:id/status` | Public generation status by detection ID. |
| Spectrogram generate | `POST /api/v2/spectrogram/:id/generate` | Public async generation request by detection ID. |
| Species image | `GET /api/v2/media/species-image` | Public thumbnail/metadata flow. |
| Species list | `GET /api/v2/species` | Public species info. |
| Species taxonomy | `GET /api/v2/species/taxonomy` | Public taxonomy hierarchy. |
| Analytics | `GET /api/v2/analytics/species/daily` | Public daily species summary. |
| Analytics | `GET /api/v2/analytics/species/summary` | Public overall species stats. |
| Analytics | `GET /api/v2/analytics/time/hourly` | Public hourly patterns. |
| HLS start | `POST /api/v2/streams/hls/:sourceID/start` | Auth required unless station enables public live audio. |
| HLS playlist | `GET /api/v2/streams/hls/t/:streamToken/playlist.m3u8` | Token-based access, good fit for `AVPlayer`. |
| HLS heartbeat | `POST /api/v2/streams/hls/heartbeat` | Keeps a stream alive. |
| Stream status | `GET /api/v2/streams/status` | Auth required. |
| Stream health SSE | `GET /api/v2/streams/health/stream` | Auth required SSE. |
| Settings dashboard | `GET /api/v2/settings/dashboard` | Public non-sensitive display preferences. |
| Settings full | `GET /api/v2/settings` | Auth required. |
| System info | `GET /api/v2/system/info` | Auth required. |
| System resources | `GET /api/v2/system/resources` | Auth required. |
| Notifications stream | `GET /api/v2/notifications/stream` | Public, rate-limited SSE. |
| Alerts | `/api/v2/alerts/*` | Mixed public/auth endpoints, requires v2 database. |
| Insights | `/api/v2/insights/*` | Public endpoints, requires v2 database. |

Important integration constraints:

- Mutating endpoints use CSRF protection. The app must fetch `/api/v2/app/config`, retain the CSRF token, and attach it to state-changing requests according to BirdNET-Go expectations.
- Auth may be BasicAuth, OAuth2/OIDC, token, API key, browser session, or local subnet depending on station configuration. The first iOS version should support the common direct login flow and be designed so other auth modes can be added cleanly.
- Some endpoints are intentionally public read-only. The app should still treat the station URL as private user data.
- HLS live audio returns a `stream_token` and playlist URL. This avoids custom-header problems with native media playback.
- Realtime streams are SSE and rate-limited. The app should reconnect with backoff and avoid opening duplicate streams.
- Some newer features, including alerts and insights, can return `409 Conflict` when the enhanced v2 database is unavailable.
- BirdNET-Go can use self-signed or local TLS. The app should plan an explicit trust model for local stations before any broad release.

## Initial App Goal

Ship a useful read-focused iOS app that connects directly to a BirdNET-Go station and gives the user a live pocket view of detections.

Initial app scope:

1. Connect to a BirdNET-Go base URL.
2. Validate station connectivity and fetch app config.
3. Log in when required and store credentials/tokens securely.
4. Show live and recent detections.
5. Show detection detail with species data, confidence, time, audio playback, and spectrogram when available.
6. Support pull-to-refresh, basic filtering, and local cache for graceful offline behavior.
7. Provide a small settings area for station connection, theme, cache reset, diagnostics, and logout.

Explicitly out of scope for the first implementation pass:

- On-device bird identification.
- Station setup wizard or full configuration editing.
- Push notification backend.
- watchOS, widgets, and Live Activities.
- Multi-station synchronization.
- Full admin controls such as restart, model reload, TLS uploads, or support dumps.

## Information Architecture

Initial navigation should be tab-based:

| Tab | Initial Purpose | Long-Term Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Feed | Live and recent detections. | Advanced filters, saved views, realtime events, new species badges. |
| Species | Species detected by the station. | Species profiles, favorite species, seasonal history, taxonomy browsing. |
| Stats | Simple daily and weekly charts. | Insights, migration patterns, dawn chorus, weather overlays. |
| Station | Connection, status, and account. | Stream health, resource usage, settings, admin controls. |

Detection detail should be reachable from Feed, Species, Stats, notifications, and search results.

## Data Model Notes

Initial domain models likely needed:

- `StationProfile`: local station metadata and connection settings.
- `StationConfig`: response from `/app/config`, including version/security/CSRF-related fields.
- `AuthSession`: authenticated state without exposing raw secrets to UI.
- `Detection`: station detection item from list/detail endpoints.
- `Species`: common name, scientific name, code, rarity, thumbnail metadata.
- `DetectionMedia`: audio URL, spectrogram URL/status, image attribution.
- `AnalyticsSummary`: daily species counts, hourly patterns, totals.
- `StreamState`: HLS token, playlist URL, source ID, heartbeat state.
- `StationHealth`: ping, health, resources, stream status, auth state.

Before coding against these models, capture real JSON samples from BirdNET-Go and make model definitions match actual response shapes.

## Testing Strategy

Planned test coverage:

- Unit tests for URL building, query encoding, and endpoint path handling.
- Unit tests for JSON decoding using captured BirdNET-Go fixtures.
- Unit tests for auth, CSRF, Keychain wrapper behavior, and redaction.
- Unit tests for SSE parsing and reconnect policy.
- UI tests for connection flow, empty states, offline states, feed, and detail playback affordances.
- Visual checks for Liquid Glass-era navigation, forms, tab bars, sheets, widgets, reduced transparency, reduced motion, and increased contrast.
- Availability tests or compile checks for iOS 26-only features and fallbacks on the chosen minimum deployment target.
- Manual integration checklist against a local BirdNET-Go station with auth disabled, auth enabled, self-signed TLS, and unavailable server states.

No tests have been written yet because implementation has not started.

## Open Questions

- What should the app be called?
- What minimum iOS version should be supported?
- Should the app require iOS 26 for the first release, or support an older minimum while using iOS 26 APIs opportunistically?
- Should the first release support only direct BirdNET-Go HTTP API, or also BirdWeather as an optional fallback?
- Which BirdNET-Go auth modes are required for the first release?
- Should self-signed certificates be supported in the first release or deferred?
- Should live audio continue while the app is backgrounded?
- Should favorite species notifications work only while the app is foreground/background-refresh capable, or should a push relay be planned early?
- Should multi-station support be part of v1 or a later release?
- Are Apple Intelligence/Foundation Models features desirable for this app, or should the product remain entirely deterministic?
- Which widgets, controls, or Live Activities are genuinely useful enough to justify APNs/backend work?
- Is this app intended for personal sideload/TestFlight use first, or public App Store distribution?

## Copilot Progress Tracking Rules

When Copilot or a contributor implements work:

1. Update the relevant status in this document.
2. Add new rows instead of overloading broad rows when work becomes concrete.
3. Keep statuses honest. Use `blocked` with a short reason when a dependency is missing.
4. Add implementation notes only when they help future work.
5. Record new API discoveries in the integration table or a short note near it.
6. Add or update acceptance criteria before marking a feature `done`.
7. Do not store credentials, station URLs with embedded secrets, API tokens, CSRF tokens, or private local network details in this file.
8. If the BirdNET-Go API changes, update the endpoint inventory before coding against the new behavior.
